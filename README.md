# Synthetic Data Generation and Autocorrelation Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analytical study on synthetic data generation and autocorrelation analysis using Python and R.

Synthetic datasets were created to mimic real-world data structures while preserving privacy, with a focus on both univariate and longitudinal data settings.

## Scope of the Study
The analysis addresses the following key questions:
- How can synthetic data be generated under different statistical distributions?
- How can time dependency be simulated in longitudinal data?
- How is autocorrelation detected and interpreted statistically?
- How do Python and R compare in synthetic data generation and analysis workflows?

## Methodology
- Synthetic data generation using Normal, Poisson, and Gamma distributions
- Univariate and longitudinal data structures
- Autocorrelation analysis (ACF, Durbin–Watson, Ljung–Box)
- Regression analysis with autocorrelated residuals

## Purpose
This repository is intended for academic and analytical portfolio use.
